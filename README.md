# Parallel Load Runner 

A nascent tool to do load testing wrapping browser automation frameworks - starting with python driven tooling such as selenium.

Realistically this tool is pseudo-tool agnostic. Though most of the work is wrapping python execution and constructing CLI flags,
it is worth acknowledging that these flags are specific to some of the existing scenarios we're working through.

Depending on how existing experiments go, this may be generalized further, or the scope articulated.
